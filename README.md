  <p>Prevento is a web application designed to help users monitor and manage their cooling devices. With Prevento, users can track the temperature of their devices, set temperature thresholds, and receive alerts when a device's temperature exceeds those thresholds. Users can also log new temperature readings for their devices, and add new devices to their account.</p>
